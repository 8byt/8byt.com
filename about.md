8byt Software is the fusion of two great minds... the minds of Danny Wolf and Sam Myers. Together, they form a force formidable even in a day of chaos and node.js. Under their wings are projects that defy logic and reason, and are mostly purely for the fun of it all. Danny is a Massachusetts native, and Sam practically is, with a smattering of California at the beginning of his illustrious career as a person.

We don't really know what we're doing, but possibly one day we will actually be good enough to do something worthwhile. It's a long shot, but there's a chance.
